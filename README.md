# Fishbone Diagram for Angular 12

This library is a typescript implementation of the [d3 fishbone](http://bl.ocks.org/uredkar/c341cb131226dc53082283b8f853be45) or [d3 fishbone](http://bl.ocks.org/bollwyvl/9239214) and the [d3-fishbone-angular](https://github.com/umitgunduz/d3-fishbone-angular) library written for angular 1. It is also updated to work with the latest [d3](https://d3js.org/) library. I'll be adding a few features to this library going forward, but at the moment, it is just a faithful implementation of the said libraries.


## Planned Features

- [ ] Ability add nodes dynamically
- [ ] Conduct a full Fishbone session starting from a empty canvas.
- [ ] Ability to customize colours and appearance for the nodes and links.

Please feel free to use github issues to request other features. I'll not be taking pull requests for the time being due to time constraints but I hope to be able to integrate any interesting features from the community in the future.

I'll also try to keep with angular updates from time to time :)
