# Fishbone Diagram for Angular 12

This library is a typescript implementation of the [d3.fishbone.js]() and the [angular-fishbone]() library written for angular 1. It is also updated to work with the latest [d3]() library. I'll be adding a few features to this library going forward, but at the moment, it is just a faithful implementation of the said libraries.
